## User

we need a function in our library that, before writing files, we can hash out secrets. E.g. API tokens etc. Is there any good library in python that can do that efficiently? So we can hide passwords/api tokens etc while keeping URLs and other high entropy but "normal" strings untouched

## Agent

Searching for Python libraries that detect and redact secrets and checking where they'd fit in the codebase.

## User

plan only

## Agent

**Plan: Secret redaction before writing**

1. **Library choice**  
   Use **plumbrc** as the redaction backend:
   - 702 built-in patterns for API keys, passwords, tokens (AWS, GCP, GitHub, Stripe, etc.).
   - Targets credential-like patterns, not generic high-entropy text, so URLs and “normal” long strings stay.
   - Simple API: `Plumbr().redact(text)` → text with secrets replaced by `[REDACTED:type]`.
   - Fast (C-backed), no extra Python deps.

   Optional: make the redactor **pluggable** (e.g. accept a `redact(text) -> text` callable) so you can swap in another implementation or a no-op later without changing call sites.

2. **Where to integrate**  
   In `engine.py`, **after** rendering and **before** writing:
   - `redacted_md = redact_secrets(render_markdown(session))`
   - `atomic_write_text(markdown_path, redacted_md)`
   - Same for JSON: `redacted_json = redact_secrets(render_json(session))` then `atomic_write_text(json_path, redacted_json)`.

   Do **not** redact inside `atomic_write_text` or inside `render_*` so that:
   - Other callers of `atomic_write_text` are unchanged.
   - Rendering stays pure; redaction is a single “before write” step.

3. **API surface**  
   - Add optional dependency: `plumbrc` in `pyproject.toml` (or under an optional group like `redact`).
   - Public API: one function, e.g. `redact_secrets(text: str) -> str` in something like `conversation_exporter/redact.py` (or `utils.py` if you prefer fewer modules).
   - Implementation: if plumbrc is available, `Plumbr(quiet=True).redact(text)`; if not (or if disabled via env/flag), return `text` unchanged so the rest of the app works without the dependency.

4. **CLI/behavior**  
   - Default: redact before writing in `sync` (and `backup` if it uses the same write path).
   - Optional: `--no-redact` (or env `CONVX_REDACT=0`) to skip redaction for local-only or debugging.

5. **Tests**  
   - Unit tests for `redact_secrets`: known secret-like strings get `[REDACTED:...]`, normal URLs and long non-secret strings unchanged.
   - Optionally an integration test: run sync on a fixture that contains a fake API key and assert the written markdown/JSON does not contain the literal key.

6. **Docs**  
   - README or CLAUDE: mention that exports are redacted for API keys/tokens/passwords by default and how to disable it.

Result: one small `redact_secrets` layer, applied only at write time, with plumbrc doing the heavy lifting so URLs and normal high-entropy strings stay intact.

## User

- let's default redact unless --no-redact
- not optional, this is a standard part of the CLI
- no need to unit test the library's functions. We trust the library, the only kind of test we need is an integration test (update existing) ensuring that a secret in the input jsonl files isn't in the output markdown files. 


one small extra: mv CLAUDE.md to AGENTS.md and symlink to the new file. So we can use the same summary doc for any agent. 

when done, test and when tests check out commit the work.

## Agent

Implementing: adding plumbrc and a redact module, then wiring it through the engine and CLI.

## Agent

Creating a fixture that contains a secret and adding an integration test:

## User

don't CREATE the AGENTS.md but `mv` the existing @CLAUDE.md ...

## Agent

Moving `CLAUDE.md` to `AGENTS.md` and creating symlink `CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md`. Removing the duplicate `AGENTS.md` I added, then running `mv` and `ln -s`.

## Agent

Updating the header in AGENTS.md so it reads as the shared agent doc:

## Agent

Done. `CLAUDE.md` has been moved to `AGENTS.md` with:

1. **`mv CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md`** – the original file is now `AGENTS.md`
2. **`ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`** – `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to `AGENTS.md`

The first lines of `AGENTS.md` were updated to the title “AGENTS.md” and the phrase “AI agents” so it works as the shared agent doc. Because `CLAUDE.md` points at `AGENTS.md`, opening either file shows the same content.

## User

just to be sure... this library is fully installable via `uv sync` or pip right?  no 3rd party binary dependencies

## Agent

**Short answer:** Yes. Everything is installable with `uv sync` or pip; you don’t install any separate third‑party binaries by hand.

**Details:**

- **convx** itself is pure Python and only needs `uv`/pip and a supported Python.
- **plumbrc** is a normal PyPI package that ships as **wheels** (including for macOS and Linux). Those wheels bundle native code (C library) that Python uses via ctypes. So:
  - You do **not** need to download or install a separate binary; `uv sync` / `pip install` pulls the right wheel for your platform.
  - On Linux/macOS, plumbrc may expect **libpcre2** to be present. It’s usually already there (e.g. on macOS and many distros); only very minimal or custom environments might need to install it.

So: **fully installable via `uv sync` or pip**, with no extra binary install steps. The only possible system requirement is libpcre2 on the machine where you run convx, which is standard on normal macOS/Linux setups.

## User

let's add docs to docs/secrets.md about how this works from user perspective and technicaily

## Agent

Added `docs/secrets.md` with:

- **User perspective:** Redaction on by default; `--no-redact` for sync/backup; what gets redacted vs left alone; that secrets appear as `[REDACTED:...]` in the written files.
- **Technical:** plumbrc and its pattern set; redaction applied after render, before write, to markdown and JSON (not the index); where it’s implemented (redact module + engine) and how the CLI passes the flag. Also notes that if plumbrc isn’t available, redaction is skipped and content is written unchanged.

## User

obviously we don't take any liability for people... they are responsible for making sure they don't leak secrets into the repo.

## Agent

Added this sentence to the intro: “You are responsible for ensuring no secrets are committed; we provide no warranty or liability.”
