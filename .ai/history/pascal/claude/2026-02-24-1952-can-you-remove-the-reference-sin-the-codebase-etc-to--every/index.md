can you remove the reference sin the codebase etc to "Every Cure" everycure etc? List everywhere you find them. then we can clean those up. Ignore tmp/history folders

## Agent

_`2026-02-24T19:52:57.906Z`_

Here are the references found (excluding history folders):

**README.md**
- Line 104: path example containing `everycure/`

**tests/test_sanitize.py**
- Lines 19-20, 25-26, 31-32, 43-44, 49, 69, 72: used as the example keyword/text throughout the sanitize tests

The `history/` folder references are in exported session transcripts — I'll skip those per your instructions.

Let me look at those two files and clean them up.

## Agent

_`2026-02-24T19:53:01.400Z`_

Now I'll replace all the references with generic placeholder names:

## Agent

_`2026-02-24T19:53:05.277Z`_

Now the test file — I'll replace the "everycure"/"Every Cure" references with generic examples like "acme corp" / "secret project":

## Agent

_`2026-02-24T19:53:16.326Z`_

Let me verify no references remain outside the history folder:

## Agent

_`2026-02-24T19:53:21.540Z`_

All remaining references are in the `history/` folder only, which you asked to ignore. Done. Here's a summary of what was changed:

**README.md:104** — `everycure/` → `my-project/` in the backup path example

**tests/test_sanitize.py** — replaced all "everycure" / "Every Cure" example keywords and text with generic "acme corp" / "secret project" equivalents. The tests remain functionally identical.

## User

_`2026-02-24T19:53:37.380Z`_

what is present in history folder then?

## Agent

_`2026-02-24T19:53:50.156Z`_

82 files total — these are your own exported AI conversation transcripts, organized as:

```
history/
  pascal/
    claude/     # 28 files — Claude Code sessions (index.md + agent-*.md + .index.json per session)
    codex/      # 6 files  — Codex sessions (.md + .json pairs)
    cursor/     # 48 files — Cursor sessions (.md + hidden .json pairs)
```

Each session has a `.md` markdown transcript and a hidden `.json` blob. The "everycure" references are inside 4 of these exported transcripts — specifically in two Cursor sessions from Feb 15 and Feb 19 — where a file path containing `everycure/` was mentioned during those conversations.

Since these are exported snapshots of past conversations (not source-controlled documentation), you'd need to either delete those specific files or re-run `convx sync --overwrite` after adding `everycure` to your `.convx/sanitize.toml` to scrub them.

## User

I thought the `sanitize` feature should have removed those why didn't it get caught

## Agent

_`2026-02-24T19:54:06.076Z`_

Good question. Let me check if a sanitize config actually exists in this repo and what keywords are in it.

## Agent

_`2026-02-24T19:54:14.072Z`_

So the keywords ARE configured. The issue is almost certainly timing — those sessions were exported *before* `sanitize.toml` was created (or before those keywords were added to it), and the idempotency system skipped re-exporting them on subsequent runs because the source files hadn't changed.

Let me verify by checking the engine's sanitize logic:

## Agent

_`2026-02-24T19:54:22.043Z`_

Confirmed. The flow at line 143 is:

```
if not force_overwrite and prior.get("fingerprint") == fingerprint:
    skip  ← those old sessions hit this branch
```

The sanitize keywords are only applied during export (lines 175–214). Since those two Cursor sessions were exported before the keywords were added, and their source files haven't changed since, the fingerprint check skips them every time.

The fix is to run with `--overwrite` to force re-export:

```bash
convx sync --overwrite
# or
convx backup --output-path <path> --overwrite
```

That bypasses the fingerprint check and re-runs sanitization on all sessions including the old ones.

## User

_`2026-02-24T19:54:36.495Z`_

can you overwrite run those once for the sync? then check what is still there and manually sed those lines

## Agent

_`2026-02-24T19:55:20.253Z`_

Still 5 matches remaining. The codex session was likely filtered by cwd, and the cursor session may have a bug where the sanitize didn't catch it. Let me read and fix them manually.

## Agent

_`2026-02-24T19:55:30.911Z`_

Now I'll fix them. The `.md` files get line replacements, then the `.json` blobs get sed'd since they're single-line.

## Agent

_`2026-02-24T19:55:39.246Z`_

Now the JSON blobs (single-line files, so use sed):

## Agent

_`2026-02-24T19:55:45.566Z`_

Now verify nothing remains:

## Agent

_`2026-02-24T19:55:51.256Z`_

Clean. All references are gone from the entire repo.

Now, the reason the `--overwrite` sync didn't catch those two: the codex session was filtered out (its cwd didn't match the convx project directory, so it was never re-processed). The cursor session is a bit more puzzling — it was "updated" but the references survived, which suggests a potential bug worth looking at. Want me to investigate why the sanitize didn't fire on that cursor session?

## User

_`2026-02-24T19:56:11.630Z`_

yeah

## Agent

_`2026-02-24T19:56:52.180Z`_

Now I can see exactly what happened. Let me check what cursor sessions are actually discoverable from source right now:

## Agent

_`2026-02-24T19:57:22.787Z`_

Found the root cause. The index entry has `updated_at: 2026-02-20` — it wasn't touched by the `--overwrite` run at all. The source is a SQLite entry in Cursor's `state.vscdb`:

```
/Users/pascal/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb::composer::33d69723-0655-4184-ba3b-fc06dd6b6afd
```

Cursor has since deleted that composer session from the DB. So `discover_files` never emits it, `--overwrite` never sees it, and the exported files sit untouched forever.

**The bug:** `--overwrite` is described as "re-export all sessions ignoring cached fingerprints", but it only applies to sessions still discoverable from source. If the source is gone (Cursor purged old composers), the exported artifacts are orphaned and immune to re-sanitization.

The same problem affects the codex session — it was filtered by cwd, not missing from source, but the effect is the same: `--overwrite` can't reach it.

**The fix** would be a second pass in the sync logic (or a separate command like `convx resanitize`) that directly applies `sanitize_lines` to already-exported `.md` and `.json` files — no source needed. It would scan the history directory, run `sanitize_lines` over each file's current content, and write it back. Want me to implement that?
