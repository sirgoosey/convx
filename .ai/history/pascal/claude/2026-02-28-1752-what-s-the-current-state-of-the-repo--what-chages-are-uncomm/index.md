what's the current state of the repo? what chages are uncommitted? Can we bring those in?

Here's the current state:

**Branch divergence:** Local has `7dc1397 better words for docs`, remote has `c745f31 chore: bump version to 0.2.4 [skip ci]` — they share the same parent (`de904ee`), so the branches diverged.

**Uncommitted changes:**

| File | What changed |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | `everycure/` → `my-project/` (sanitizing client name in example path) |
| `tests/test_sanitize.py` | All `everycure` references → `acme corp` (generic placeholder) |
| `history/pascal/codex/...` | Updated codex session export files |
| `history/pascal/cursor/...` | Updated cursor session export files |
| `uv.lock` | Minor lockfile update |
| `history/pascal/claude/2026-02-24-.../` | New untracked Claude session directory |

The changes are coherent — they're continuing the work of sanitizing the client name (`everycure`) out of the codebase with generic placeholders.

**To bring them in, you have two options:**

1. **Merge/rebase from remote first** — the remote has a version bump to 0.2.4 that your local branch is missing. You'd want to `git pull --rebase` then commit your working tree changes.
2. **Commit locally first, then reconcile** — commit these changes now, then sort out the divergence.

Would you like me to proceed with committing these changes? And how would you like to handle the divergence with `origin/main` — rebase, merge, or something else?

commit locally and then pull / push, it's just a v bump remotely
